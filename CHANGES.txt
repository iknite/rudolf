This isn't really in proper GNU ChangeLog format, it just happens to
look that way.

2014-04-18 Enrique Paredes <enrique@iknite.com>
	* 0.4 release 
	* python3 (3.3 & 3.4) support
	* Test revamping to be compatible to the different python versions. 
	  Instead of mocking sys.stdout, now shows the result directly. 
	  It uses a single test.py file and no further dependencies.

2007-12-22 John J Lee <jjl@pobox.com>
	* 0.3 release
	* Fix test timing output
	* Be more compatible with other plugins, by setting result.stream
	  instead of returning from .setOutputStream() (thanks Jason
	  Pellerin for suggesting how to fix this)
	* Support 256 colour terminals
	* Add --colors option to configure colours (can be used in config
	  files or environment too, as usual)
	* Change back to green expected, red actual in diff output.  Also
	  colorize the "-expected +actual" text to make it clearer.
	* Other minor stuff

2007-11-17 John J Lee <jjl@pobox.com>
	* 0.2a release
	* Change doctest diff colours (swap red / green so red is used for
          removed lines, green for added lines).
	* Fix some easy_install stuff.
	* Refactoring.

2007-10-21 John J Lee <jjl@pobox.com>
	* 0.1a release (first release)
	* Copied colour output code from zope.testing 3.5.0 file
	  testrunner.py, and modified it heavily to work with nose.
